**ERC777 and ERC1363: Problem Solving and Introduction Rationale**


<u>ERC777</u>

What Problems Does ERC777 Solve?
1. User-Friendly Transactions: ERC777 was designed to be a more user-friendly standard by providing more transactional information and allowing for more advanced interactions with smart contracts.

2. Improved Security: It addresses the well-known security issues of ERC20 tokens related to the approve and transferFrom methods.

3. Hooks for Smart Contracts: The introduction of hooks allows smart contracts to react to receiving tokens, enabling more complex transaction scenarios and interactions.

4. Advanced Token Handling: Tokens can be sent with additional data, and recipients can reject tokens, which wasnâ€™t possible with ERC20.

5. Operator Delegation: Operators can be authorized to send and burn tokens on behalf of other addresses, enabling automated and delegated token management.

Issues with ERC777
1. Complexity and Overhead: The additional features introduce more complexity, which could increase the potential for smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities.

2. Potential for Malicious Use: Hooks can potentially be used in a malicious manner if a token holder interacts with a malevolent contract.

3. Backward Compatibility Concerns: Even though ERC777 aims to be backward compatible with ERC20, the new functionalities may cause unexpected behavior in systems designed for ERC20 tokens only.

<u>ERC1363</u>

Why Was ERC1363 Introduced?
1. Payment Simplification: ERC1363 was introduced to simplify the token-based payment process by allowing for execution of a callback function, making it possible for contracts to handle tokens and trigger functions in a single transaction.

2. Enhancement of Token Utility: This standard extends the utility of tokens by enabling them to represent not only value but also to execute specific functions upon transfer, thereby acting as a proxy for payment and notification.

3. Reducing Transaction Steps: It reduces the number of steps needed for a contract to acknowledge token receipt and perform an action, such as confirming a product purchase or initiating a subscription service.

What Issues Are There with ERC777 that ERC1363 Addresses?
1. Simplified Payment and Notification Process: Unlike ERC777, which provides a more complex set of interactions, ERC1363 focuses on the payment and notification process, offering a simpler and more direct way to manage contract interactions post-payment.

2. Callback on Actions: ERC1363 introduces the transferAndCall and approveAndCall patterns, which directly handle the execution of associated contract functions, something that is not the primary aim of ERC777.

3. Specific Focus on Payments: ERC1363's design is specifically tailored for payment scenarios, providing a clear standard for tokens intended to be used in this manner, while ERC777 is a more general-purpose improvement over ERC20.
